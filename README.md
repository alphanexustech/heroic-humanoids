# Heroic Humanoids
Generic base project form demonstrating web based prototypes

# Overview
Game Development Steps:

1. Build a simple game with a win/lose ratio (67% lose, 33% win) and deploy it as a static build to S3 (Amazon Simple Storage Service), showcasing how to deliver the game to an audience.
2. Add issues for a guessed Minimum Viable Product (MVP) based on the attached image, which illustrates the planning process for the game's development.
3. Work on the issues while avoiding scope creep.
4. Either declare the MVP finished or return to step 2 if the product seems viable for further development.

Thank you for clarifying the details on your whiteboard for "Heroic Humanoids." Let's break down the game concept and structure:

Gameplay Loops:
- The player engages in a versus battle represented by two stick figures.
- Winning the battle grants the player a point ("Reward +1").
- The player can choose to play again, returning to the versus battle, or use their points to improve aspects of the game.
- The improvements can be made in three areas:
  1. The character itself ("Improve").
  2. The setting or environment (like changing wave function algorithms or modifying tiles).
  3. A third option, which is currently undecided and marked with a question mark.

Character Structure:
- The character sheet starts with a shaded square labeled "Name."
- "Attributes" is listed as a subtitle, with three dashes indicating future-defined attributes.
- "Can improve tiles" with five squares suggests that the character can upgrade five different aspects or "tiles."
- "Strong against" and "Weak against" each have three squares, hinting at a Pokémon-style mechanic for strengths and weaknesses.

Game Idea for Dice Rolling:
- The game's universe is not strictly defined by fantasy or sci-fi genres, allowing for a range from elves to robots ("elves to robots dimension") and from critters to real ("critters to real dimension").
- Character creation is open-ended, demonstrated by a simple stick figure, emphasizing that a "humanoid" can be any form.
- A "humanoid" is fundamentally composed of two elements: a head and a body, reinforcing the basic structure of characters in the game.

This whiteboard serves as the foundational data structure for the game, outlining the core mechanics, character development, and thematic openness of "Heroic Humanoids." It's a flexible framework designed to be built upon as the game's development progresses.

The "Heroic Humanoids" game concept you've detailed outlines a structured yet flexible approach to game development that's quite promising. Here are some feedback points:

1. **Win/Lose Ratio**: The 67% win and 33% lose ratio should be tested to ensure it feels rewarding yet challenging to players. You might want to consider dynamic difficulty adjustments based on player performance to maintain engagement.

2. **MVP Approach**: Focusing on a Minimum Viable Product is smart, as it allows you to get player feedback early. However, ensure that even the simplest version of the game is fun and engaging.

3. **Gameplay Loops**: The loop is clear and straightforward, which is great for habit formation and player retention. Consider adding variety or surprises within the loop to keep the gameplay fresh.

4. **Character Structure**: The upgrade system seems intriguing, but make sure the upgrades have a noticeable impact on gameplay to give players a sense of progression.

5. **Dice Rolling Mechanism**: Having a non-specific universe can be a double-edged sword. It allows for creative freedom but can also make the game feel unfocused. Ensure there’s enough lore or world-building to make the universe compelling.

6. **Character Creation**: The open-ended character creation is a strong point for inclusivity and player expression. However, ensure that each form has its unique gameplay implications to add depth to the choices.

Incorporating generative AI into "Heroic Humanoids" could indeed open up an array of possibilities, from dynamically created content to personalized player experiences. It could serve to generate unique character attributes, create diverse enemies, or even craft personalized storylines based on player behavior. The challenge will be to integrate AI in a way that feels organic and enhances the game’s core mechanics without overwhelming the development process or straying from the MVP. It's a powerful tool, but like any feature in game development, it should be implemented with careful consideration of its impact on gameplay and player satisfaction.
